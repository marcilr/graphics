PSD - A .PSD file is a layered image file used in Adobe PhotoShop.  PSD, which stands
      for Photoshop Document, is the default format that Photoshop uses for saving data.
      PSD is a proprietary file that allows the user to work with the images' individual
      layers even after the file has been saved.[1]

      Photoshop definitely got it right with the PSD file format.  It saves the complete
      state of a still-being-edited image so that you can close down and resume work later.
      When working with images, you should always keep a PSD copy around in case you need
      to make tweaks to the image later on.

      The problem is that PSD is not an open format.  While PNGs, JPGs, and BMPs can be
      opened in nearly every image editor out there, PSD is special ---  and it needs
      special support. 
      ...
      GIMP should honestly be your first stop when trying to open and edit a PSD file for
      free.  Not only is it the closest counterpart to Photoshop itself, but it's available
      across Windows, Mac, and Linux, so you can learn it once and use it on all of your
      systems.[2]
